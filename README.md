The DatingApp repos is the result of a Udemy course by Neil Cummings.

https://aryza.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/


In this course a whole application is build with Asp.net for the back-end and Angular for the front-end.

For me this is my first introduction in web app building with Angular. Therefore I keep notes in several .md files in this repository that serve as a guide for future projects that I build with the techniques used in this course.
